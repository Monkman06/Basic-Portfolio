       <code>Work History <br> I am currently looking to change careers. For the last few years, I worked as a personal trainer at several gyms in New Jersey and New York City. Initially, fitness was a rewarding field; eventually I became tired of seeing my clients treated like nothing more than a spreadsheet cell by bureaucrats.<br>
      Education<br> I graduated from high school in 2005 and graduated from college in 2008 & 2010. I have an Associates of Science Degree in CriminalJustice from County College of Morris and a Bachelors of Arts in History from the University of Maine in Orono. In five years of college I only missed only one class and that was because I was still memorizing the schedule. <br>
      Personal/ Miscellaneous<br> I am an introverted and very private person. One of my proudest accomplishments is losing 100 pounds; it took 15 months to lose and I have kept it off since April 2006. Some of my interests include playing chess, reading history, solving crossword puzzles, and playing airsoft.</code>
