       <li> Work History <br> I am currently looking to change careers. For the last few years, I <br>worked as a personal trainer at several gyms in New Jersey and<br> New York City. Initially, fitness was a rewarding field; eventually <br>I became tired of seeing my clients treated like nothing more than<br> a spreadsheet cell by bureaucrats. Upper management willfully<br> ignored reality in favor of blind adherence to unilateral policy; <br>the last straw was when cooperate cared more about low sales<br> than the health department raiding the gym. </li>  
      <li> Education <br> I graduated from high school in 2005 and graduated from college<br> in 2008 & 2010. I have an Associates of Science Degree in <br> CriminalJustice from County College of Morris and a Bachelors<br> of Arts in History from the University of Maine in Orono. In five<br> years of college I only missed only one class and that was because<br> I was still memorizing the schedule. I also have two primary <br>personal trainer certifications and four specialties. </li> 
      <li>Personal/ Miscellaneous <br> I am an introverted and very private person. One of my proudest <br>accomplishments is losing 100 pounds; it took 15 months to lose <br> and I have kept it off since April 2006. Some of my interests <br> include playing chess, reading history, solving crossword puzzles,<br> and playing airsoft.  </li>                              
    </ul>
